# electric-calculations

A personal website for electrical calculations including features for calculating voltage, current, resistance, and power. The website should have a clean and intuitive interface with interactive elements for users to input their values and receive calculations in real-time. Ideal color scheme could include shades of blue and grey to reflect an electrical theme. Navigation should be straightforward, with clear sections for each type of calculation.
